# whitewine
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data 
(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
citric acid (g / dm^3)
residual sugar (g / dm^3)
chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
density (g / cm^3)
pH
sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
alcohol (% by volume)

Output variable (based on sensory data):

quality (score between 0 and 10)
